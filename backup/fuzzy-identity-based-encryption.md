# functionality

Traditional cryptosystems requires that the encryption key and decryption key should match in one-to-one correspondence, despite that the keys are the same in symmetric cryptosystems and seperated in asymmetric cryptosystems. FIBE relaxes this restriction, it enables that a ciphertext can be decrypted by several keys and a key can decrypt several ciphertexts encrypted by different keys.
