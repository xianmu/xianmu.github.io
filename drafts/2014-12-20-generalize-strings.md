title: Generalize Strings
---

There are many ways to view strings. The common one is just a finite sequence of symbols.

Another one is consider a string as a single directed path with labels on the edges. Some people prefer the labels on the vertices instead of the edges, and it would imply different kind of generalizations. 

The circular string, would be a cycle with labeled edges.

If we take the path view(undirected), then the natural problem would be generalize string to labeled trees.
